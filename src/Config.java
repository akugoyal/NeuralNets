/**
 * This class represents the configuration of an N-layer neural network. It stores the following
 * parameters:
 *
 * numActLayers:           the number of layers in the network.
 * INPUT_LAYER:            the index of the input layer in the network. This is always 0.
 * FIRST_HIDDEN_LAYER:     the index of the first hidden layer in the network. This is always 1.
 * LAST_HIDDEN_LAYER:      the index of the last hidden layer in the network. This should be one
 *                         less than the OUTPUT_LAYER index.
 * OUTPUT_LAYER:           the index of the output layer in the network. This should be one
 *  *                      less than the number of layers in the network (numActLayers).
 * numActsInLayers:        the number of activations in each layer. This defaults to 1 for each
 *                         layer.
 * lowRand:                the lower bound for the random number range, which may be used to
 *                         randomize the weights. This defaults to 0.0.
 * highRand:               the upper bound for the random number range, which may be used to
 *                         randomize the weights. This defaults to 0.0.
 * loadWeights:            whether to load the weights from a file. This defaults to false.
 * weightsFile:            the file to load/save the weights from/to. This defaults to the value
 *                         passed in the constructor.
 * networkMode:            0 if the network is training, 1 if the network is running all cases in
 *                         the truth table, 2 if the network is running only one case in the
 *                         truth table. This defaults to 0.
 * numCases:               the number of cases in the truth table. This defaults to 1.
 * maxIters:               the maximum number of iterations for training. This defaults to 0.
 * lambda:                 the learning rate. This defaults to 0.0.
 * errThreshold:           the error threshold to end under for training. This defaults to 0.0.
 * truthTableFile:         the file containing the truth table. This defaults to the value passed
 *                         in the constructor.
 * runCaseNum:             the case number to run in the truth table. Used only when networkMode is
 *                         2 (Run single case). This defaults to 0.
 * keepAliveInterval:      the interval to print status updates to the console during training. This
 *                         defaults to 0 (disabled).
 * decimalPrecision:       the number of decimal places to round the weights to. This defaults to 17.
 * activationFunction:     the activation function to use. This defaults to sigmoid.
 * saveWeightsInterval:    the interval at which to save weights during training. Defaults to 0
 *                         (disabled). If this is greater than 0, weights will be saved at the
 *                         end, regardless of network mode.
