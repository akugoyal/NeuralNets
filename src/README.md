# N-Layer Neural Network
This is a simple implementation of a fully connected, feed forward N-Layer Neural Network in 
Java, following the design documents created by Dr. Eric R. Nelson at The Harker School. The 
ultimate goal of the project is to create a neural network that can be trained to recognize 
small, grayscale images. The network is trained using backpropagation-optimized, gradient descent 
algorithm. The network supports multiple activation functions and configuration parameters.
